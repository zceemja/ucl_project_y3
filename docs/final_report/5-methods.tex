This chapter lays out your approach. 
What did you actually do to reach your goal, or attempt to reach your goal? 
What equipment did you use? 
How did you build the device? 
How did you set up the simulation: what mesh values, for example, did you use?

Provide enough detail that your work can be duplicated by someone else.
Be precise and use the correct units.
