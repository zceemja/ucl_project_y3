One Instruction Set Computer (OISC), commonly implemented as Transport Triggered Architectures (TTAs) is a promising architecture that is successfully used in Application-Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIPs) exploiting operation style parallelism, while keeping simplicity and flexibility. There is a lack of research in general purpose OISC with single data-instruction bus that could be used in lower power and performance comparable to a 8bit microcontroller using traditional Reduce Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture. The paper designs two novel 8bit RISC and OISC processors, and investigates their characteristics and performance when implemented on FPGA. OISC required only a half of logic elements comparing to RISC, however it takes 71\% longer to execute designed benchmark, showing that OISC would need more than one data-instruction bus to outperform RISC.
