This chapter presents the background physical or electrical theory
and on any analytical methods you will use to accomplish your goals.
If you have a research question, what is it?
Have you made any deductions from it that you are now testing?
What mathematical bases must be understood in order to interpret your results in Chapter 5?
Give the reader a solid understanding of the foundations here.

RISC that this paper will be exploring is classical SISO (single instruction, single operation) processor. TTAs are usually of type SIMT (single instruction, multiple transports) \autocite{289981}; A middle between these two classes is SIMO type (single instruction, multiple operation)

\textbf{Decided design criteria:}
\begin{description}
	\item[$\bullet$] Minimal instruction size
	\item[$\bullet$] Minimalistic design
\end{description}

%There are many papers looking into application specific TTAs.
