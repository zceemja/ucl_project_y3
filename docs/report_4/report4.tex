\subsection{Completed OISC implementation}
In this section brief OISC implementation will be described.

OISC machine code is stored in 13bits instructions that compose 1 bit that indicates if source is immediate value, 4 bits for destination address, 8 bits for source address or immediate value. This been shown in diagram below:

\definecolor{c1}{HTML}{ff7568} 
\definecolor{c2}{HTML}{8cbfff} 
\definecolor{c3}{HTML}{a6ddb7} 
\begin{gather*}
\scalebox{0.8}{bit index:}
\underbrace{\colorbox{c1}{0}}_\text{imm.}
\underbrace{
	\colorbox{c2}{1}\,
	\colorbox{c2}{2}\,
	\colorbox{c2}{3}\,
	\colorbox{c2}{4}\,
}_\text{destination}
\underbrace{
	\colorbox{c3}{5}\,
	\colorbox{c3}{6}\,
	\colorbox{c3}{7}\,

	\colorbox{c3}{10}\,
	\colorbox{c3}{11}\,
	\colorbox{c3}{12}
}_\text{source}
\end{gather*} 

Such design been chosen to match RISC's small instructions design. Tables \ref{table:oisc_dst_instr} and \ref{table:oisc_src_instr} describes currently implemented OISC source and destination addresses.

\subsection{OISC Benchmark}
Following functions have written in assembly for OISC:
\begin{description}
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{print\_char}: writes byte to terminal.
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{read\_char}: reads byte from terminal.
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{print\_bin}: prints 8bit value as binary to terminal.
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{print\_hex}: prints 8bit value as hexadecimal to terminal.
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{print\_u8}: prints unsigned 8bit value as digit to terminal.
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{print\_u16}: prints unsigned 16bit value as digit to terminal.	
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{print\_string}: prints string (until 0x00 is reached)from memory to terminal.
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{mul\_u16}: Multiply 16bit numbers to produce 32bit result. Seems like easier to implement than in RISC due to possibility to use \texttt{MEMLO}/\texttt{MEMHI} instructions as general purpose registers.	
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{mod\_u16}: Uses Russian Peasant multiplication to calculate 16bit modulus
	\item[$\bullet$] \texttt{calc\_sieve}: Uses Sieve of Atkin algorithm to populate memory and mark prime numbers from 5 to 255 (up to 8bits), 16bit calculation is already started. A more memory efficient code was written comparing to RISC, it packs every number as 1bit instead of 1 memory cell (16bits)

\end{description}


\subsection{Improved assembler}
Two new features have been added to assembler (which applies for both RISC and OISC)

\subsubsection{Macros}
Operators \texttt{\%macro} and \texttt{\%endmacro} allows to define code that can be reused multiple times.

\subsubsection{Definitions}
Operator \texttt{\%def} allows to define a variable name under local scope (inside function) so assembly code would be easier to read. Example:
\\\\
\texttt{
function\_label: \quad; function name\\
\%def \$x,REG0  \qquad; define REG0 as \$x\\
\$x 10			\qquad\qquad; set REG0 to decimal 10 \\
} 


\section{Difficulties encountered}
Multiple difficulties has been encountered:

\subsection{Timing}
There were multiple timing issues between source/destination latches/registers and common data bus. These issues were difficult to remove because initially ModelSim was running into cycling loop which did not allowed to proceed with simulation and locate issue. 
Secondly when this was resolved and simulation worked, synthesised code on FPGA did not work causing some issues when moving data from ALU calculated location back to ALU register. This been temporary resolved by adding negative edge sensitive flip-flop to ALU inputs which results is reducing time for combinational logic to settle by two.

\subsection{Memory instructions}
While writing benchmark programs another issue has been discovered - memory instructions (read to/write from memory and push to/pop from stack) cannot be used in single instruction e.g.: \\\\
\texttt{
	MEMP  0x0000	\quad; macro to set memory pointer\\
	MEMHI 0xFF		\quad; write immediate to memory high byte \\
	STACK MEMHI		\quad; push memory high byte to stack \\
} 

This will result in unexpected result as instruction tries to read and write from memory at the same time with two different addresses, therefore it can potentially store data to a unknown address. Current work-around is to avoid such instruction combination by storing value to a temporary register. This usually does not cause extra instructions as in most cases values from memory/stack are required and stored in temporary registers anyway. 

\subsection{ROM memory}
Initial implementation of OISC stored instruction in 16bit, 2048 word configuration using M9K memory. As this was inefficient recently a decision was made to implement this using 3 M9K memory blocks with 2 instructions sliced into 3 - 9bits slices and stored in each memory block (extra bit is kept as parity check). This been successfully implemented in SystemVerilog and tested with ModelSim but still does not work with FPGA.

One of the problems is representation of non-integer byte sizes and multiple file formats used for each case - ModelSim uses \texttt{\$readmemh} or \texttt{\$readmemb} functions that reads file with raw binary or hexadecimal numbers; Quartus uses "mif" format which is quite well documented and already implemented; writing into ROM without resynthesising HDL requires reversed hexadecimal format, however it is not documented how it has to be represented when memory width is not an integer byte. 

Furthermore probes might be implemented to record internal processor registers by using Quartus "In-System Sources and Probes" feature. This would allow quickly debug programs and find out any other problems related to processor.
